# Introduction

Hello, my name is Rodrigo AlcÃ¡ntara, game developer specialized in programming and design. I am sending you this application to your job offer *BATTLE PROGRAMMER - CA Sofia*.I have already participated in several games as a programmer (mainly in systems and mechanics) and since a season ago is that I have been interested in *CREATIVE ASSEMBLY* mainly in Total War games. Since a few years I have played several of the titles such as the Total War saga of warhamer Fantasy and Total War Pharao. Not counting those games I am no stranger to other products focused on the strategies, in the digital would be the starcraft saga or as a strategy game in physical would be the own warhamer 40k in the current edition 10. I firmly maintain that strategy games are the biggest challenges in terms of design is concerned, which is why I am interested in being part of the future projects of *CREATIVE ASSEMBLY*.

To corroborate all that I have said here would be several of the games that I have participated in its development or other games or prototypes of my own.
